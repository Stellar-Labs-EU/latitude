## What is the Latitude SDK?

Latitude is a framework to build interactive data apps on top of your database or data warehouse (or even static CSV files!) using code.

With Latitude, you can write parameterized SQL queries to pull and transform your data, and use our simple frontend components to display it. The framework takes care of the plumbing, so you can focus on building the best possible data experience for your users.

## Quick start

Here's a quick getting started guide to get the sample app up and running:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Latitude SDK">
    Run the following command to install the Latitude SDK globally on your machine:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @latitude/sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the starter project">
    Run this command to create a new Latitude project:
    ```bash
    latitude start
    ```
    The CLI will ask you the project name. Once you're done, you'll have a new directory with a sample app that you can run and customize.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the project and run the app">
    ```bash
    cd my-new-app
    latitude dev
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the sample app in your browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>

From here, you can start customizing the app to fit your needs. You can add new queries, modify the frontend, and deploy the app to share it with others.
