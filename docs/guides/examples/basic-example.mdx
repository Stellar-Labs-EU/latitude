## Introduction

This guide will walk you through creating a simple data app using Latitude. You'll learn how to:

1. [Create a new data app](#1-create-a-new-data-app)
2. [Add a data source](#2-add-a-data-source)
3. [Write your queries](#3-write-your-queries)
4. [Define the layout and visualizations](#4-define-the-layout-and-visualizations)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you followed the [installation guide](/guides/getting-started/installation) to install Latitude.

## 1. Create a new data app

To create a new data app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
latitude start
```

Type in the name of your app and press enter. This will create a new directory with the name of your app and a basic structure for your app.

After the app is created, navigate to the app's directory and start the development server by running the following commands:

```bash
cd my-app
latitude dev
```

This will start the development server and open your app in your default browser.

## 2. Add a data source

To add a data source to your app, you'll need to create a new file in the `sources` directory.

For this guide, we'll use the CSV that comes with the sample project, but you can replace that with any other CSV or connect to a live database following [these instructions](/sources).

## 3. Write your queries

Now that you have a data source, you can write your first query. Create a new file named `sample.sql` in the `queries` directory and write the following query:

```sql sample.sql
SELECT *
FROM read_csv('source.csv')
```

This query will select all the rows from the `source.csv` file using our default DuckDB adapter (you don't need to configure anything else to get this working).

Next, let's create a secondary query to aggregate some data. Create a new file named `sample_agg.sql` in the `queries` directory and write the following query:

```sql sample_agg.sql
SELECT
  release_year,
  COUNT(*) AS total_titles,
FROM { ref('sample') }
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 ASC
```

This query will count the number of titles released each year. The `ref` function is used to interpolate the `sample.sql` query, and use its results as the input for this query. Latitude allows you to chain queries together very easily, find out more about this in the [queries reference](/queries).

## 4. Define the layout and visualizations

Now that you have your queries, you can define the layout and visualizations for your app. The sample project comes with a basic layout and visualization, but you can customize it to fit your needs. You can find it in the `views` folder, named `index.html`.

Open the `index.html` file in your text editor and replace the content with the following:

{/* TODO: add the actual sample layout here */}

Once you're done, save the file and go to your browser to see the changes reflected in your app in real-time.

## Next steps

You've successfully created a simple data app using Latitude. You've learned how to create a new app, add a data source, write queries, and define the layout and visualizations. You can now build on this knowledge to create more complex data apps and explore the full capabilities of Latitude.
