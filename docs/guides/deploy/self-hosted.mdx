## Build for production

To build the production version of your data app run the following command:

```bash
latitude build
```

Once done, access it with:

```bash
cd build
```

And run it with:

```bash
node build
```

## Docker container

Every Latitude project comes with a Dockerfile to streamline containerization. Use the command below to build a Docker container with your data app's production version:

```bash
docker build .
```
