## Introduction

The recommended way to build the production version of your Latitude project is as a Docker
container. This approach is useful if you want to deploy your app on your own
infrastructure or you want to use one of the many Docker-based PaaS providers
as your deployment target.

## Docker container
<Note>
  You will need the [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed in your machine.
</Note>

Every Latitude project is equipped with a Dockerfile to facilitate
containerization. To build the Docker container for your Latitude project,
proceed as you would with any other Docker project:

```bash
docker build . -t my-latitude-app
```

Once the build is complete, you can test your app locally with:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-latitude-app
```

See the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/build/) documentation for more details.

### Environment variables in production builds
Keep in mind .env variables are not available in production builds for security reasons â€“ you should use environment variables instead. You can set them in the Dockerfile or pass them as arguments when running the container. For example, if you had a .env file with the following content:

```bash
LATITUDE__DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

You could pass the environment variable to the container like this:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e LATITUDE__DB_PASSWORD=mypassword my-latitude-app
```
