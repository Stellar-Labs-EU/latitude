## Introduction

The Latitude CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your Latitude projects. It provides a set of commands to help you create and serve your Latitude projects.

To get a list of all available commands, you can run the following command:

```bash
latitude --help
```

## Creating a new project

To create a new Latitude project, you can use the `start` command. This command will create a new directory with the specified project name and initialize it with the necessary files and folders.

```bash
latitude start
```

The `start` command will prompt you to enter the name of your new project. Once you've entered the name, the command will create a new directory with the specified name and initialize it with the necessary files and folders.

## Local development

To serve your Latitude project locally, you can use the `dev` command. This command will start a local development server that will serve your project on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
latitude dev
```
