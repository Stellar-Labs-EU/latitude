## Introduction

The Latitude CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your Latitude projects. It provides a set of commands to help you create and serve your Latitude projects.

To get a list of all available commands, you can run the following command:

```bash
latitude --help
```

## Creating a new project

To create a new Latitude project, you can use the `start` command. This command will create a new directory with the specified project name and initialize it with the necessary files and folders.

```bash
latitude start
```

The `start` command will prompt you to enter the name of your new project. Once you've entered the name, the command will create a new directory with the specified name and initialize it with the necessary files and folders.

## Local development

To serve your Latitude project locally, you can use the `dev` command. This command will start a local development server that will serve your project on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
latitude dev
```

## Running queries

To check that your queries are working as expected, you can run them locally using the `run` command. For example:

```bash
latitude run sample
```

This will run the `/queries/sample.sql` query once and display the results in your terminal.

If your query is in a sub-folder within the `/queries` folder, make sure to include the sub-folder name in the command. For example:

```bash
latitude run sub-folder/sample_agg
```

If, instead, you want to run the query in watch mode, you can add the `-w` or `--watch` flag to the command. For example:

```bash
latitude run sample_agg --watch
```

Now, every time you save the file, the query will be re-run and the results will be displayed in your terminal.
