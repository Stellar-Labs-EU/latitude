## Folder structure

A Latitude project is structured as follows:

```plaintext
data-app/
├── queries/
├── views/
```

As you can see, the project is divided into two main folders: `queries` and `views`.

### Queries

The `queries` folder contains all the SQL queries that are used in the project. Each query is saved in a separate file with the `.sql` extension.

To find more about how to write queries, check the [Queries](/queries) section.

In this folder is also where the database connections are set up. You can do so by creating a `source.yml` file next to your queries.

Make sure to check the [Sources](/sources) section to learn more about how to set up connections.

### Views

The `views` folder contains all the views that are used in the project. Each view is saved in a separate file with the `.html` extension.

Views use the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework to create interactive and reactive user interfaces. On top of that, we've developed a library of components that you can use to build your views. To find more about how to write views, check the [Views](/views) section.
