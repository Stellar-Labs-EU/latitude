You can include elements into the `<head>` element of your application with `<svelte:head>` component. This is useful for adding meta tags, styles, and scripts to your document.

You can use the `<svelte:head>` component in any view, it will automatically add the elements to the `<head>` of the document.

Here's an example:

```jsx
<svelte:head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This is my page" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</svelte:head>
<View>
    ...
</View>
```
