description: 'How to create and configure sources within your Latitude project'

## File format and location

- To configure a source, the file must be a `.yaml` file. 
- It must be located in the `/queries` folder on the first level.
- It can also be located in subfolders, but always within `/queries`.
- One file represents one connection. Don't put more than one connection in one file.
- The filename is the one you must use in your queries.
- Files for queries `.sql` and sources `.yaml` will live together in `queries/`.

## Hierarchy

### Subfolders

The source file can be located in any folder within `/queries`. This means you can create subfolders within `queries/` and sources can be in those subfolders.

```
    queries/
    ├── product/
    ├── ├── active_users.sql
    ├── ├── snowflake_product.yaml
```

### Source Proximity

The query files will take the data from the nearest source. This means that it will try to find a source in the same level and if there is no source it will go to the previous folder level one and other time up to find a source.

So in the following example the query `queries/aggregations/total_subscriptions_by_country.sql` will go to the previous level and take the data from `queries/postgresql.yaml` because in its level there is no source.
```
    queries/
    ├── postgresql.yaml/
    ├── subscriptions.sql
    ├── aggregations/
    ├── ├── total_subscriptions_by_country.sql
```
