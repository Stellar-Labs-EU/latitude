## File Requirements and Directory Structure
- **Source Files:** Must be `.yaml` or `.yml`.
- **Location:** All source files should be placed in the `queries` directory. This includes being nested within any subdirectories under `queries`.
- **One Connection Per File:** Each `.yaml` file represents a unique connection. Do not mix multiple connections in a single file.
- **Naming:** Use the `.yaml` filename in your queries to reference the source.
- **Co-location:** `.sql` query files and `.yaml` source files should all reside within the `queries` directory or its subdirectories.

## Directory Hierarchy and Source Discovery

#### Subdirectories
- You may organize your source files in subfolders within the `queries` directory.
Example:
queries/
│── product/
├── active_users.sql
├── snowflake_product.yaml


#### Source Resolution
- Queries will utilize the closest source file in their directory hierarchy. If a source file isn't found in the same directory, the query will search each parent directory until a source file is discovered.
Example:
queries/
├── postgresql.yaml
├── subscriptions.sql
├── aggregations/
├── total_subscriptions_by_country.sql

*In this scenario, `total_subscriptions_by_country.sql` will use `postgresql.yaml` as its source since it doesn't have a closer source file in its directory (`aggregations`).*
