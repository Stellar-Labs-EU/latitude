## Attributes

- **Project ID** → The unique identifier for your Google Cloud project. It's like the address for where all your BigQuery activities live, helping Google know which project your data and queries belong to.
- **Credentials** → The keys or authentication details your application needs to prove it has permission to access your BigQuery data.
- **Token** → A special security code your application uses to make secure requests to BigQuery.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
