## Introduction

Variables and constants store values you can later use anywhere in your query.

## Basic Usage
Variables are placeholders that can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the SQL code.

To assign a value to a variable, use the equal sign `=` followed by the value.
```jsx
{name = 'foo'}
{age = 30}
{sum = 2 + 4} 
```

For example, take a look at the following Latitude Query, and what will actually be compiled and executed in the database:
<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Query
/* Defining the variable and SQL code */

{sum = 2 + 4} 

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id = {sum}

```

```sql Compiled SQL
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id = 6
```
</CodeGroup>

### Incrementing
Variables can be modified using operations such as addition.

<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Query
{counter = 10} /* Define the variable */

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != null
AND (
    {#each [1, 2, 3] as products, index}
        /* Print the value of the variable */
        id = {counter}

        /* Add an 'OR' at the end to every element except the last one */
        {#if index + 1 < products.length}
            OR
        {/if}

        /* Increment the value of the variable */             
        {counter = counter + 10}
    {/each}
)
```
```sql Compiled SQL
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != null 
AND (
  id = 10 OR
  id = 20 OR
  id = 30
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Constants
Constants are similar to variables but, once defined, their value cannot be changed. Also the main syntax difference is constants are defined using the `@const` keyword.

```jsx
{@const name = 'value'}
```

```jsx Your Query
{@const birthday = '2000/02/28'} /* Defined a constant */

SELECT *
FROM table
{#if birthday = '2000/02/28'}
    {birthday = '2024/12/31'} /* Reassigning the constant */
{/if}
```
```sql Output
'!Error: Cannot reassign a constant'
```

## Scope
### Global
Variables defined outside of any logic blocks are considered global and can be modified and accessed throughout the entire code.
```jsx
{var1 = 'latitude'}
```

Variables can be accessed and modified anywhere in the code.
<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Query
{name = 'latitude'} /* Define the variable */

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE name = {name}
{name = 'longitude'} /* Reassign the variable */
OR name = {name}
```
```sql Compiled SQL
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE name = 'latitude'
OR name = 'longitude'
```
</CodeGroup>


### Local Variables
Variables defined within logic blocks are local to that block. They cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are defined.

``` jsx
{#if condition}
    {var2 = 'localValue'} /* Accessible only within this block */
{/if}
```
